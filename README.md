# Alternative-Language-Project


Which programming language and version did you pick?

--> I chose Java (specifically Java 8) for this project. Java is a widely-used, versatile, and robust programming language known for its portability, strong community support, and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools.

Why did you pick this programming language?


How your programming language chosen handles: object-oriented programming, file ingestion, conditional statements, assignment statements, loops, subprograms (functions/methods), unit testing and exception handling. If one or more of these are not supported by your programming language, indicate it as so. 

-->Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Java fully supports OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.File Ingestion: Java provides classes like BufferedReader and FileReader for reading files efficiently.Conditional Statements and Loops: Java supports conditional statements (if-else, switch) and loop constructs (for, while, do-while) for control flow.Assignment Statements: Java uses standard assignment operators (=) for assigning values to variables.Subprograms (Methods): Java employs methods (functions) to encapsulate behavior and promote code reuse. Unit Testing: Java supports unit testing using frameworks like JUnit for writing and executing test cases.
Exception Handling: Java uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions, ensuring robust error management.

List out 3 libraries you used from your programming language (if applicable) and explain what they are, why you chose them and what you used them for.
Answer the following questions (and provide a corresponding screen showing output answering them):

(Screenshot of answers will be in the directory of this folder!)


--> JUnit: A widely-used unit testing framework for Java. Used for writing and executing test cases (assertEquals, etc.).
java.util.regex: Java's regex package for pattern matching (Pattern, Matcher).
java.util.HashMap: Used for storing average weights by OEM.
